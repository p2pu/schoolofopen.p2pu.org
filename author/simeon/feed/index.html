<p>We hosted 20 girls from Precious Blood Secondary School, Riruta for the event. The goal was to work with these students to map out education as they currently experience it in their school and figure out how best to incorporate Open Education in their learning.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, we mapped out learning and education activities as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures/Class instruction</li>
<li>Private study/prep</li>
<li>Group study</li>
<li>Revision of past examination papers</li>
<li>Student Symposiums</li>
</ul>
<p>We asked them if we could add aspects of Open Education to this list. Very few of the students had heard about Open Education or understood its value at this point.</p>
<p>We discussed Open Education in a little more detail: We explored the concept of the commons, copyright and copyleft and how the Creative Commons suite of licenses has enabled the Open Education movement globally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most of the afternoon, the emphasis on the workshop centered on figuring out how the students could incorporate Open Education in their learning.</p>
<p>One of the themes that stood out is getting school administrations and teachers to understand and make an investment in Open Education. This will be Jamlab&#8217;s focus in the coming year.</p>
<p>While we work with administrators and teachers, we encouraged students to begin to demonstrate the value of Open Education by creating demand for it in the following ways: consume OER&#8217;s and integrate them in their learning, and pro-actively create and share OER&#8217;s with other students from other schools.</p>
<a href="http://jamlab.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812" src="http://jamlab.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n.jpg" alt="10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n" width="960" height="543" /></a>
<p>Jamlab is committed to facilitating this.</p>
<p>Back to the video.</p>
<p>I think one thing we often forget to highlight when it comes to education is how we learn.</p>
<p>From the video, we learn to crawl, then stand on our two feet, then learn to take a few steps and sooner than later, we&#8217;re running around at high speeds. We learn by building on what we already know. We believe Open Education is one sure way of building on what we already know to advance ourselves.</p>
