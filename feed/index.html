<p>It’s now been a couple of weeks since we formally ended our four-week <a title="Open Research Course" href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2377/open-research/" target="_blank"><em>Open Research</em></a> course on P2PU … And what a month it was! We had 139 people sign up to the course, which looked at the theory and practice of open research, how you can be ethical and open, how to disseminate in the open and open reflection. You can view the course materials <a title="P2PU Open Research Course " href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2377/open-research/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>From the very first discussions about the course last fall with <a title="Jane Park blog post on OERRH visit " href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40393" target="_blank">Jane Park at Creative Commons</a> to the team brainstorming the course early in 2014, spending several months co-authoring the course and developing assets, going through <a title="School of Open Community Review " href="https://p2pu.hackpad.com/School-of-Open-Course-Review#School-of-Open-Course-Review" target="_blank">School of Open’s community review</a>, getting the course up on the P2PU platform, creating <a title="P2PU Open Research Badge " href="https://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/563/" target="_blank">our badge</a>, and running the course itself, it’s been a fascinating and rewarding process. Collaboration was central to building the course and as an <a title="Open Research blog post " href="http://oerresearchhub.org/2014/06/19/open-research-course-update/" target="_blank">earlier blog post</a> shows continuous evaluation and input was essential to make <em>Open Research</em> possible.</p>
<p>As a team we’re still reflecting on the experience of creating and running the course, but would like to thank everyone who contributed, commented, reviewed materials and participated. The range of course participants, from all over the world and with all kinds of backgrounds and interests in open research, who joined us on the Hangouts and commented in the forums or used the course Twitter hashtag (#openresearch) was quite amazing and it was a privilege to work with so many people who were keen to share their ideas and experiences during the course.</p>
<p>We look forward to building on the success of this first iteration of <em>Open Research</em>, while also looking at where we can improve the material and course design. A post-course survey, forum comments and blog posts by participants as well as the team’s reflections will all feed into this review process. In addition, if you did not participate in the course but have suggestions or feedback, we would welcome your thoughts via <a title="Hackpad " href="https://p2pu.hackpad.com/Open-Research-Course-Feedback-and-Suggestions-tUU5LikTyxS" target="_blank">this Hackpad</a>. A second facilitated version of the course is planned for early 2015 and a stand-alone version will also be made available.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who made the course possible!</p>

<p>Today Mr. Joseph Tiampati, Principal Secretary of the Ministry of ICT of Kenya gave a speech to formally launch the School of Open Africa in Nairobi. The full text of the speech is below and also available as a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PS-speech-during-the-Launch-SCHOOL-OF-OPEN-AFRICA-22ND-OCT.-2014.pdf">PDF</a>. In addition, a congratulatory message from Prof. Jacob Kaimenyi, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology was delivered by Mr. John Temba, Head of ICT in Education at the Ministry. More info on the event from our announcement post <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/44015">yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry recognizes Kenya as a signatory of UNESCO’s 2012 Paris Declaration on Open Educational Resources (OER) and that &#8220;open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by providing more opportunities for the realisation of universal access to education.&#8221;</li>
<li>Kenya has developed and is rolling out a National ICT Master plan for the next five years. The Ministry recognizes &#8220;that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan&#8230; Open Education Resources coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge-based economy.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly,</p>
<blockquote><p>“By using Open Educational Resources, OER, School of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education, especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education. Ongoing, voluntary, and self- motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century. One of the major ways of promoting life-long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education.</p>
<p>“I congratulate School of Open teams across Africa for the innovative and transformative mode of teaching and learning that we are launching today. This African initiative is a worthy model for other regions of the world to emulate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats on a successful launch to our communities across Africa!</p>

<p><strong>SPEECH BY MR. JOSEPH TIAMPATI, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY DURING THE LAUNCH OF THE SCHOOL OF OPEN AFRICA, AT THE SERENA HOTEL, WEDNESDAY 22ND OCTOBER, 2014</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me great pleasure to be here today as the Chief Guest during the launch of School of Open &#8211; Africa. I would like to begin by sincerely thanking Creative Commons Africa community and under the able coordination of Alex Gakuru and Tobias Schonwetter, and the global Creative Commons Community for inviting me to preside over this launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to note the enthusiasm demonstrated by School of Open Africa in transforming education along Sustainable Development Goals proposed for post-2015 (Goal No. 4: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all”) and in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 which seeks to transform Kenya into a middle-income country that offers high quality of life to all citizens by the year 2030. I am happy to note how much School of Open Africa has grown in Kenya and embraced in countries like Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa among other African countries in the last few years. I am informed that School of Open by Creative Commons is highly reputed around the world for addressing universal access to education.</p>
<p><span style="float: right;padding: 10px"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SOO-africa-launch-event-5.jpg" alt="SOO Africa Launch Event 5" /><br />
<small>Awarding CopyrightX certificates / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="license">CC BY</a> / Phillip Ranja</small></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kenya is a signatory to the UNESCO&#8217;s 2012 Paris Declaration on Open Education Resources licensed under Creative Commons open licenses. The use of open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by providing more opportunities for the realisation of universal access to education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials in any medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fully aware of the role of education in a country’s development agenda, I am sure that the new initiatives being undertaken by School of Open Africa, the Creative Commons and UNESCO are making their contribution towards the social, economic, and political pillars which are the three fundamental cornerstones of our country, and indeed for our great continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, as you may be aware, the Country’s development blue print is being implemented through successive five- year Medium Term Plans (MTPs) that will finally enable the country to achieve the long-term goals. We are now in the second medium term plan cycle (2013-2017) whose theme is “Transforming Kenya: Pathways to Devolution, Socio-economic Development, Equity and National Unity”. As you may be aware, the ICT Authority rolled out the National ICT Master plan that will set the pace for progression of the country in ICT for the next five years. The Master plan – once fully rolled out – will completely transform government processes, services and management, and make information access and service delivery more efficient. Again, the Master plan, with the flagship projects to pilot its implementation, will steer the march towards the digital future that will transform the country to a regional technical hub, raise the country’s competitiveness and align the country in line with vision 2030’s ICT goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;By launching the Kenya ICT Master Plan, the government revealed its commitment towards the enhancement of access to quality education and training through ICT in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are reviewing the National ICT Policy Guidelines to ensure alignment with proposed Sustainable Development Goals.<br />
As a country, we are also privileged to have a National ICT Policy whose goal is to create a prosperous ICT-driven Kenyan society. With a well mainstreamed ICT society, we are assured of better livelihoods of Kenyans attainable through the availability of accessible, efficient, reliable and affordable ICT services.</p>
<p>&#8220;ICT provides a platform that enables the realization of these goals. I must emphasize that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan. The integration of ICT into educational programmes places both the teaching staff and students at the forefront in the utilization of ICT for the enhancement of lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I note with great pleasure the freedom to re-purpose offered by openly licensed educational resources, the convenience online access to learners as alternative courses delivery and certification methods. At this juncture, ladies and gentlemen, I thank William Fisher III, Professor of Intellectual Property and his staff at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School for providing a free copyright law course taught to graduands present today to receive their certificates. I also thank Michael Murungi (then CEO, National Council for Law Reporting or “Kenya Law”) and Alex Gakuru for successfully conducting the course in Nairobi. I must congratulate the former students and ask to make the very best use of the copyright law knowledge they acquired while also challenging all universities represented here to consider emulating the highly successfully CopyrightX initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the government continues to work on modalities of ensuring universal access to education and increasing the internet penetration in all parts of the country, we are pleased to witness this mode of study that will definitely translate to affordable education. Open Education Resources coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;By using Open Educational Resources, OER, School of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education, especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education. Ongoing, voluntary, and self- motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century. One of the major ways of promoting life-long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate School of Open teams across Africa for the innovative and transformative mode of teaching and learning that we are launching today. This African initiative is a worthy model for other regions of the world to emulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I conclude I take this opportunity to applaud UNESCO&#8217;s efforts and contribution in the development and growth of the country through this noble initiative that enables the primary, secondary and universities to optimize the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in learning. I acknowledge the generous financial support from the Hewlett Foundation and SOO Africa teams support by Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;With those remarks, it is now my pleasure to declare the School of Open Africa officially opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our Creative Commons and School of Open volunteers in Kenya, including CC Regional Coordinator <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#alexgakuru">Alex Gakuru</a>, are hosting a formal launch event of School of Open Africa in celebration of the School of Open programs <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43856">launched last month</a> in Africa, and to announce new programs in higher education. The event will feature a panel discussion with senior government officials from the Kenyan Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Ministry of ICT along with Dr. Bitange Ndemo (University of Nairobi) and regional representatives from UNESCO and Google regarding the status of open education in Africa, School of Open&#8217;s contributions and future. Alex says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This event will help establish a conversation platform for policymakers around School of Open Africa, connecting and synchronising education and ICT policies with the innovative open education programs being led by Creative Commons volunteers in Africa. It will also connect current School of Open programs in primary and high school education to academia and NRENs<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_research_and_education_network">1</a></sup> &#8212; towards the realisation of the international aspiration for universal access to education.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional attendees include professors from local universities and law schools; participants of the copyright law course, <a href="http://copyx.org/affiliates/nairobi-kenya-cb/">CopyrightX:Kenya</a>, who will be awarded certificates of completion; our CC Kenya affiliates; and School Open Kenya leads. </p>

<p>In addition to the panel, SOO Kenya&#8217;s Simeon Oriko will present on School of Open Africa programs led to date, and Dr. Tonny Omwansa with C4DLab at the University of Nairobi will announce a new School of Open program to develop OER courses for higher education. This program will serve as a model for other universities across Africa to develop high quality open educational resources for use in higher education under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>. In celebration, CC t-shirts in Kiswahili will be distributed, &#8220;mwananchi mbunifu,&#8221; aka &#8216;creative commoner.&#8217;</p>
<p>The event is hosted at the Serena Hotel in Nairobi and will last from 9am-1pm, followed by a celebratory lunch. The event and new OER program in higher education is made possible with technical support from UNESCO and generous financial support from the Hewlett Foundation. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September, the School of Open Africa launched with nine programs distributed across four jurisdictions: Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, and South Africa. Kayode from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Nigeria">CC Nigeria</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43400">announced</a> in the launch in August, and now we want to give you an update on how the programs (some ongoing) and launch events fared! We also want to preview more events to take place during <a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a> and tell you our plans for the future of School of Open in Africa. </p>
<h4>School of Open Kenya</h4>
<p style="text-align:center" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-kenya-4.jpeg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-kenya-4.jpeg" alt="SOO Kenya popjam" /><br /><small><a href=""><span property="dc:title">SOO Kenya Popjam</span></a> / <span property="cc:attributionName">Jamlab</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a></small></p>
<p>Simeon from <a href="http://jamlab.co.ke/">Jamlab</a> <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/popjam-school-of-open-africa-kenya-event/">says</a>, &#8220;We hosted 20 girls from Precious Blood Secondary School, Riruta for the [launch] event. The goal was to work with these students to map out education as they currently experience it in their school and figure out how best to incorporate Open Education in their learning. For most of the afternoon, the emphasis on the workshop centered on figuring out how the students could incorporate Open Education in their learning. After a brief discussion, we mapped out learning and education activities as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures/Class instruction</li>
<li>    Private study/prep</li>
<li>    Group study</li>
<li>    Revision of past examination papers</li>
<li>    Student Symposiums</li>
</ul>
<p>We asked them if we could add aspects of Open Education to this list. Very few of the students had heard about Open Education or understood its value at this point. We discussed Open Education in a little more detail: We explored the concept of the commons, copyright and copyleft and how the Creative Commons suite of licenses has enabled the Open Education movement globally.&#8221;</p>
<p><u>The future of SOO Kenya:</u></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the themes that stood out is getting school administrations and teachers to understand and make an investment in Open Education. This will be Jamlab’s focus in the coming year. While we work with administrators and teachers, we encouraged students to begin to demonstrate the value of Open Education by creating demand for it in the following ways: consume OER’s and integrate them in their learning, and pro-actively create and share OER’s with other students from other schools.&#8221;</p>
<h4>School of Open Tanzania</h4>
<p style="text-align:center" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-tanzania_group.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-tanzania_group.jpg" alt="SOO Tanzania" /><br /><small><a href=""><span property="dc:title">SOO Tanzania launch</span></a> / <span property="cc:attributionName">CC Tanzania</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></small></p>
<p>Paul from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Tanzania">CC Tanzania</a> <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/cc-tanzania-launched-the-school-of-open-in-style/">says</a>, &#8220;The program officially launched at Academic International Primary School (AIPS) in Dar es Salaam whereby 15 students from grades four to seven got the opportunity to learn how to code, designing animated picture (cartoons) by using open educational resources through the web.&#8221;</p>
<p><u>The future of SOO Tanzania:</u></p>
<p>&#8220;The event also marked the launch of three other training programs around ICT empowerment training for unemployed youth, teaching persons with disabilities how to use computers, and training educators on using ICT to improve how they teach their students in Tanzania that will be coordinated by CC Tanzania and the Open University of Tanzania.&#8221;</p>
<p>CC Tanzania will also highlight the importance of open access to research during Open Access Week in collaboration with the Tanzania Medical Students Association (TAMSA). </p>
<h4>School of Open Nigeria</h4>
<p style="text-align:center" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-nigeria-4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soo-nigeria-4.jpg" alt="SOO Nigeria" /><br /><small><a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/91116545@N03/15212584119/"><span property="dc:title">SOO Nigeria Saturday training</span></a> / <span property="cc:attributionName">K-Why</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></small></p>
<p>Kayode from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Nigeria">CC Nigeria</a> <a href="http://creativecommonsng.org/">says</a>, &#8220;Creative Commons Nigeria with support from Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Linux Professional Institute (Nigerian Master Affiliate) and Mozilla Foundation hosted the School of Open. The School of Open is a five week open course that holds every Saturday between 11am till 4pm. The first week started on September 13th with participants been trained on the basics of Intellectual Property, Linux Operating System and using simple Mozilla tools to design websites.&#8221;</p>
<p><u>The future of <a href="http://creativecommonsng.org/school-of-open-nigeria/">SOO Nigeria</a>:</u></p>
<p>The five-week programs wrapped over the weekend with a discussion on plans for sustaining the community. The next phase will be to take School of Open Nigeria online with the present participants acting as moderators. Meanwhile, people and institutions in two different states (Imo State and Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun State) have requested that Creative Commons Nigeria come replicate School of Open in their societies. The aim of School of Open Nigeria will be to have an online learning place where people can go to learn at any time without any cost or time restrictions. </p>
<h4>School of Open South Africa</h4>
<p style="text-align:center" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bus_bus3.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bus_bus3.jpg" alt="Kumusha bus" /><br /><small><a href="http://www.wikiafrica.net/projects/kumusha-bus/"><span property="dc:title">Kumusha Bus</span></a> / <span property="cc:attributionName">WikiAfrica</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a></small></p>
<p>Kelsey from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/South_Africa">CC South Africa</a> says they already ran their School of Open CC4Kids course as part of Code4CT&#8217;s Maker Party <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/school-of-opens-cc4kids-at-the-code4ct-maker-party/">back in July</a>, and since then have been planning the next phase of <a href="http://www.wikiafrica.net/projects/kumusha-bus/">Kumusha Bus</a>, aka <a href="http://www.wikiafrica.net/kumusha-bus-2-0-apply-now/">Kumusha Bus 2.0</a>, which is &#8220;a remix of Libre Bus and designed to ensure collaboration with local members of the open community to have a week of Open Movement chaos and fun that spreads the ideas behind the movement and gets more people and organisations involved in your country.&#8221; Kumusha Bus is a collaboration of WikiAfrica, Creative Commons, and School of Open.</p>
<p><u>The future of SOO South Africa:</u><br />
Kelsey &#038; co are planning to expand <a href="http://www.obami.com/portals/Obami_School/CC/Course">CC4Kids</a> into a full course pack designed to teach kids about Wikipedia, open journalism, open data, and open/citizen science. As part of this expansion, a session will be run at the upcoming Mozilla Festival called &#8220;OpenMe &#8211; Kids Can Open&#8221;. </p>
<h4>More about the future</h4>
<p>School of Open Africa is hosting another event next week, 22 October, to launch its entrance into the higher education space. Four courses will be developed in collaboration with the C4DLab, the University of Nairobi&#8217;s innovation hub, and will be licensed <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>. The project is a response to ICT playing a critical role in expanding the knowledge economy of Africa; the OER will be developed by and for Africans; and the hope is to replicate the process in other universities. In addition, certificates will be awarded to participants of <a href="http://copyx.org/affiliates/nairobi-kenya-cb/">CC Kenya&#8217;s CopyrightX satellite</a> from earlier this year, a panel discussion on OER will be featured, and SOO Kenya will present its work to date. The event and C4DLab OER project is made possible with technical support from UNESCO and generous support from the Hewlett Foundation. Stay tuned for a more detailed announcement of this event next week!</p>
<p>At its core, School of Open is about equipping communities with the tools to help them do what they already do better. Creative Commons licenses and the open resources they enable empowers users around the world to, as Simeon of SOO Kenya <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/popjam-school-of-open-africa-kenya-event/">says</a>, &#8220;build on what we already know.&#8221; He says,  </p>
<blockquote><p>I think one thing we often forget to highlight when it comes to education is how we learn&#8230; We learn by building on what we already know. We believe Open Education is one sure way of building on what we already know to advance ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are seeking to expand School of Open to other regions, in and beyond Africa. The upcoming <a href="http://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a> will feature a session on mapping School of Open programs from around the world and hone in on areas with maximum potential for impact &#8212; where we can &#8220;train the trainers&#8221; or otherwise empower student and educator communities to start up programs for themselves. Find out how you can <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/get-involved/">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is Copyright 4 Educators (AUS)?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2553/copyright-4-educators-aus/">Copyright 4 Educators (AUS)</a> is a free online course for anyone who wants to learn about Australian copyright law, statutory licensing, educational exceptions and open educational resources (OER). It is open to all educators around the world, specifically targeted to teachers, teacher-librarians from K-12, and university students studying to become teachers in Australia. The course material is learnt around practical case studies faced by teachers when using copyright material in their day-to-day teaching and educational instruction.</p>
<p>The Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course is not taught; it is facilitated by course leaders. The course emphasizes student participation. Students are divided into small groups in which they organise their online communications/discussions (via email, Google docs, Skype, tokbox, and other tools) and jointly submit answers to each week’s task.</p>
<p>The course leaders review each group’s work that has been submitted to that week’s Google document and provide feedback. As stated above, the leaders act as facilitators rather than traditional teachers.</p>
<p>The Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course has successfully been run seven times previously.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) – Next Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The next Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course will run for seven weeks, with a two-week introduction period and five weeks of substantive material. Each week covering substantive material will be comprised of a different case scenario and tasks. Each group will have one week to complete each week’s tasks and two days to provide peer review to two other groups.</p>
<p><strong>Course Breakdown by weeks:</strong></p>
<p><em>1. October 27: Welcome to the course and introductory questionnaire </em></p>
<p>Course participants acquaint themselves with the course and introduce themselves by answering a questionnaire. The questionnaires should be completed by Sunday November 2.</p>
<p><em>2. November 3: Group meet and greet </em></p>
<p>Course participants are divided into groups &#8211; meet and greet with fellow group members as well as become acquired with the ICT tools needed in the course, which will allow the group members to make a decision on the collaborative tool the group will use. This decision should be made by November 9 in preparation for your first group task in week 3.</p>
<p><em>3. November 10: Copyright Basics</em></p>
<p>Week 3 is the first week of substantive material, covering copyright basics such as subject matter categories, whether copyright applies, and copyright ownership. Group answers need to be submitted to that week’s google doc by the end of Sunday November 16, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie November 18.</p>
<p><em>4. November 17: Statutory licences </em></p>
<p>Week 4 covers statutory licences and what teachers are and are not permitted to do under the statutory licences. Group answers need to be submitted to that week’s google doc by the end of Sunday November 23, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie November 25.</p>
<p><em>5. November 24: Educational exceptions </em></p>
<p>Week 5 covers educational exceptions and smartcopying techniques that allow teachers to use copyright material outside of the statutory licences, without the permission of the copyright owners and without paying any fees. Group answers need to be submitted to that week’s google doc by the end of Sunday November 30, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie December 2.</p>
<p><em>6. December 1: OER </em></p>
<p>Week 6 covers open educational resources (OER). OER are a great alternative to copyright material as it removes copyright questions and allows teachers to do much more with the material. These resources are completely free for any individual to use, are licensed for unrestricted distribution, and allow the possibility of adaptation, translating, re-mix, and improvement. Group answers need to be submitted to that week’s google doc by the end of Sunday December 7, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie December 9.</p>
<p><em>7. December 8: Law Reform</em></p>
<p>Week 7 builds on everything that’s been covered in the course and requires groups to think about copyright law reform. Group answers need to be submitted to that week’s google doc by the end of Sunday December 14, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie December 16.</p>

<p>12.09.2014 will be one of the memorable days for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cc.tanzania?ref=bookmarks">Creative Commons Tanzania</a> in many years to come as they successfully hosted and launched its CC for kids event for the first time as part of the School of Open (SOO) and <a href="https://party.webmaker.org/">Mozilla maker party</a> programs that was globally celebrated and launched on the same day. This also made CC Tanzania and Tanzania to be the first country in East Africa to do so for such kind of program this year.</p>
<p>The program officially launched at Academic International Primary School (AIPS) in Dar es Salaam whereby 15 students from grades four to seven got the opportunity to learn how to code, designing animated picture (cartoons) by using open educational resources through the web. The event also marked the launch of three other training programs around ICT empowerment training for unemployed youth, teaching persons with disabilities how to use computers, and training educators on using ICT to improve how they teach their students in Tanzania that will be coordinated by CC Tanzania and the <a href="http://www.out.ac.tz/">Open University of Tanzania</a>.</p>

<p>We hosted 20 girls from Precious Blood Secondary School, Riruta for the event. The goal was to work with these students to map out education as they currently experience it in their school and figure out how best to incorporate Open Education in their learning.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, we mapped out learning and education activities as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures/Class instruction</li>
<li>Private study/prep</li>
<li>Group study</li>
<li>Revision of past examination papers</li>
<li>Student Symposiums</li>
</ul>
<p>We asked them if we could add aspects of Open Education to this list. Very few of the students had heard about Open Education or understood its value at this point.</p>
<p>We discussed Open Education in a little more detail: We explored the concept of the commons, copyright and copyleft and how the Creative Commons suite of licenses has enabled the Open Education movement globally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most of the afternoon, the emphasis on the workshop centered on figuring out how the students could incorporate Open Education in their learning.</p>
<p>One of the themes that stood out is getting school administrations and teachers to understand and make an investment in Open Education. This will be Jamlab&#8217;s focus in the coming year.</p>
<p>While we work with administrators and teachers, we encouraged students to begin to demonstrate the value of Open Education by creating demand for it in the following ways: consume OER&#8217;s and integrate them in their learning, and pro-actively create and share OER&#8217;s with other students from other schools.</p>
<a href="http://jamlab.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812" src="http://jamlab.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n.jpg" alt="10670106_514289218674810_625668591336484405_n" width="960" height="543" /></a>
<p>Jamlab is committed to facilitating this.</p>
<p>Back to the video.</p>
<p>I think one thing we often forget to highlight when it comes to education is how we learn.</p>
<p>From the video, we learn to crawl, then stand on our two feet, then learn to take a few steps and sooner than later, we&#8217;re running around at high speeds. We learn by building on what we already know. We believe Open Education is one sure way of building on what we already know to advance ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>P2PU + School of Open filed comments yesterday in support of Net Neutrality! </p>
<p>You can access the full comments at <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P2PUSchoolofOpenNNReplyComments.pdf">http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P2PUSchoolofOpenNNReplyComments.pdf</a>. It should be available on the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/comments">FCC site</a> soon. Here is the Executive Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) and the School of Open leverage the Internet and open educational resources (OER) to create an innovative, peer-based learning model that anyone in the world can use, with or without an institution. The FCC’s proposal would undercut the efforts of P2PU and related organizations by relegating them to the “slow lane” on the Internet, discouraging millions of would-be learners from pursuing further education to improve their careers and local economies. Research conducted on these learning models would also be hampered, slowing progress and the growth of services that depend on efficient access to resources.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>We therefore agree with the comments of the startup community, investors, nonprofits, and millions of Americans calling for rules against unreasonable discrimination and access fees under Title II, and we disagree with the comments by AT&#038;T, Verizon, Comcast in favor of the Chairman’s fast-lane proposal.</em></p></blockquote>
