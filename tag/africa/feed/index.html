<p>Today Mr. Joseph Tiampati, Principal Secretary of the Ministry of ICT of Kenya gave a speech to formally launch the School of Open Africa in Nairobi. The full text of the speech is below and also available as a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PS-speech-during-the-Launch-SCHOOL-OF-OPEN-AFRICA-22ND-OCT.-2014.pdf">PDF</a>. In addition, a congratulatory message from Prof. Jacob Kaimenyi, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology was delivered by Mr. John Temba, Head of ICT in Education at the Ministry. More info on the event from our announcement post <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/44015">yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry recognizes Kenya as a signatory of UNESCO’s 2012 Paris Declaration on Open Educational Resources (OER) and that &#8220;open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by providing more opportunities for the realisation of universal access to education.&#8221;</li>
<li>Kenya has developed and is rolling out a National ICT Master plan for the next five years. The Ministry recognizes &#8220;that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan&#8230; Open Education Resources coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge-based economy.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly,</p>
<blockquote><p>“By using Open Educational Resources, OER, School of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education, especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education. Ongoing, voluntary, and self- motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century. One of the major ways of promoting life-long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education.</p>
<p>“I congratulate School of Open teams across Africa for the innovative and transformative mode of teaching and learning that we are launching today. This African initiative is a worthy model for other regions of the world to emulate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats on a successful launch to our communities across Africa!</p>

<p><strong>SPEECH BY MR. JOSEPH TIAMPATI, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY DURING THE LAUNCH OF THE SCHOOL OF OPEN AFRICA, AT THE SERENA HOTEL, WEDNESDAY 22ND OCTOBER, 2014</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me great pleasure to be here today as the Chief Guest during the launch of School of Open &#8211; Africa. I would like to begin by sincerely thanking Creative Commons Africa community and under the able coordination of Alex Gakuru and Tobias Schonwetter, and the global Creative Commons Community for inviting me to preside over this launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to note the enthusiasm demonstrated by School of Open Africa in transforming education along Sustainable Development Goals proposed for post-2015 (Goal No. 4: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all”) and in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 which seeks to transform Kenya into a middle-income country that offers high quality of life to all citizens by the year 2030. I am happy to note how much School of Open Africa has grown in Kenya and embraced in countries like Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa among other African countries in the last few years. I am informed that School of Open by Creative Commons is highly reputed around the world for addressing universal access to education.</p>
<p><span style="float: right;padding: 10px"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SOO-africa-launch-event-5.jpg" alt="SOO Africa Launch Event 5" /><br />
<small>Awarding CopyrightX certificates / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="license">CC BY</a> / Phillip Ranja</small></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kenya is a signatory to the UNESCO&#8217;s 2012 Paris Declaration on Open Education Resources licensed under Creative Commons open licenses. The use of open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by providing more opportunities for the realisation of universal access to education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials in any medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fully aware of the role of education in a country’s development agenda, I am sure that the new initiatives being undertaken by School of Open Africa, the Creative Commons and UNESCO are making their contribution towards the social, economic, and political pillars which are the three fundamental cornerstones of our country, and indeed for our great continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, as you may be aware, the Country’s development blue print is being implemented through successive five- year Medium Term Plans (MTPs) that will finally enable the country to achieve the long-term goals. We are now in the second medium term plan cycle (2013-2017) whose theme is “Transforming Kenya: Pathways to Devolution, Socio-economic Development, Equity and National Unity”. As you may be aware, the ICT Authority rolled out the National ICT Master plan that will set the pace for progression of the country in ICT for the next five years. The Master plan – once fully rolled out – will completely transform government processes, services and management, and make information access and service delivery more efficient. Again, the Master plan, with the flagship projects to pilot its implementation, will steer the march towards the digital future that will transform the country to a regional technical hub, raise the country’s competitiveness and align the country in line with vision 2030’s ICT goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;By launching the Kenya ICT Master Plan, the government revealed its commitment towards the enhancement of access to quality education and training through ICT in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are reviewing the National ICT Policy Guidelines to ensure alignment with proposed Sustainable Development Goals.<br />
As a country, we are also privileged to have a National ICT Policy whose goal is to create a prosperous ICT-driven Kenyan society. With a well mainstreamed ICT society, we are assured of better livelihoods of Kenyans attainable through the availability of accessible, efficient, reliable and affordable ICT services.</p>
<p>&#8220;ICT provides a platform that enables the realization of these goals. I must emphasize that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan. The integration of ICT into educational programmes places both the teaching staff and students at the forefront in the utilization of ICT for the enhancement of lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I note with great pleasure the freedom to re-purpose offered by openly licensed educational resources, the convenience online access to learners as alternative courses delivery and certification methods. At this juncture, ladies and gentlemen, I thank William Fisher III, Professor of Intellectual Property and his staff at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School for providing a free copyright law course taught to graduands present today to receive their certificates. I also thank Michael Murungi (then CEO, National Council for Law Reporting or “Kenya Law”) and Alex Gakuru for successfully conducting the course in Nairobi. I must congratulate the former students and ask to make the very best use of the copyright law knowledge they acquired while also challenging all universities represented here to consider emulating the highly successfully CopyrightX initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the government continues to work on modalities of ensuring universal access to education and increasing the internet penetration in all parts of the country, we are pleased to witness this mode of study that will definitely translate to affordable education. Open Education Resources coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;By using Open Educational Resources, OER, School of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education, especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education. Ongoing, voluntary, and self- motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century. One of the major ways of promoting life-long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate School of Open teams across Africa for the innovative and transformative mode of teaching and learning that we are launching today. This African initiative is a worthy model for other regions of the world to emulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I conclude I take this opportunity to applaud UNESCO&#8217;s efforts and contribution in the development and growth of the country through this noble initiative that enables the primary, secondary and universities to optimize the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in learning. I acknowledge the generous financial support from the Hewlett Foundation and SOO Africa teams support by Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;With those remarks, it is now my pleasure to declare the School of Open Africa officially opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After months of discussions, deliberations and planning between CC staff, African Regional Coordinators, African Affiliate teams and others in the open space, Creative Commons Africa is set to storm Africa by having a continent-wide launch for School of Open in September.</p>
<p>School of Open is a global community of volunteers providing free online courses, face-to-face workshops, and innovative training programs on the meaning, application, and impact of &#8220;openness&#8221; in the digital age. Through School of Open, you can learn how to add a Creative Commons license to your work, find free resources for classroom use, open up your research, remix a music video, and more!</p>
<p>School of Open programs will be launched in Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, and South Africa in September on a series of topics ranging from Creative Commons licensing, intellectual property protection, open society concepts, and the Linux operating system.</p>
<p>Strategic collaborations are underway with the Mozilla Foundation, Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, WikiAfrica, University of Lagos, University of Tanzania, and the Institute of Educational Management Technology of the Open University of Tanzania to make the launch a success.</p>
<h4>School of Open Kenya&nbsp;&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://creativecommons.org/images/international/ke.png"/></h4>
<p><a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/training-programs/#soo-kenya">School of Open Kenya</a> already started out as a trail blazer by organizing a two-week after school program that introduces high school students to open culture through the use of online School of Open courses and related open educational resources (OER). The training was designed to satisfy the academic needs of the students and to enable the students to use open tools such as Creative Commons licenses to create and share knowledge, as well as learning required subjects in new and creative ways. The students integrated the School of Open training into their school work and were able to produce projects such as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1y5Z4yHmWE">Titration Demo video</a> by the Lenana School under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. Despite its long strides, <a href="http://jamlab.co.ke/">Jamlab</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Kenya">CC Kenya</a> are not resting their oars; they will be launching a Train the Trainers program this September where they will train 10+ community members to organize and run SOO workshops in more high schools and in neighboring countries. SOO Kenya will also host a SOO Africa launch event and Maker Party entitled PopJam. Jamlab + CC Kenya, in collaboration with Mozilla Kenya and Wikipedia Kenya, will host the event for 5 high schools in the region. Stay tuned for details!</p>
<h4>School of Open South Africa&nbsp;&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://creativecommons.org/images/international/za.png"/></h4>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/South_Africa">CC South Africa</a> hosts three projects under the School of Open initiative. The first is the #<a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/training-programs/#openafrica">OpenAfrica project</a> where in conjunction with WikiAfrica, open advocates from Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Malawi, Uganda and Ghana were put through an &#8220;open&#8221; bootcamp. The month-long camp covered Creative Commons, Wikipedia, Open Street Maps, Open Educational Resources (OER), Open Data, Open Government, and related fundraising and community building skills. Advocates returned equipped with &#8220;open&#8221; knowledge and skills to their home countries to influence and spur their communities into action. This has resulted in the creation of new CC affiliate teams in Ethiopia and Cote d’Ivoire and the launch of open mandated tech hubs in these communities. </p>
<p>Launching off #OpenAfrica, participants were invited to compete for the first Kumusha Bus stop. The Kumusha Bus is an African adaption of the South American <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29436">Libre Bus</a>. Ethiopia &#8216;won&#8217; the first Kumusha Bus stop. The team spent four days inspiring, teaching and sharing at GIZ Headquarters in Addis Ababa. Participants from Sheger Media, AIESEC and Addis Ababa University were in attendance. The four days resulted in the launch of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectluwi">Project Luwi</a>. Luwi is an open source project, aiming to increase the application of open source information and communication technologies (ICT). Luwi intends to create a local community of interested volunteers that is able to foster motivation and creativity around Open Educational Resources (OERs) and supports a culture of sharing information freely in Ethiopia. </p>
<p>The third project is the <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/training-programs/#cc4kids">Creative Commons for Kids program (CC4Kids)</a>. <a href="http://www.obami.com/portals/Obami_School/CC/Course">CC4Kids</a> was built with Obami, a South Africa-based social learning platform. The course is self-taught and takes about 45 minutes to complete. CC South Africa was invited to teach its first course as part of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43335">Maker Party at the Code for Cape Town project (Code4CT)</a> with 24 grade 10 and 11 girls from the Centre for Science and Technology (COSAT) in Cape Town, South Africa. For three weeks the girls were trained on how the web works and actively participated in building web content. Instead of policing students’ actions, CC4Kids teaches youth how to open and share their creative and educational works legally through the use of CC licenses. All the girls now have simple web pages they created. CC4Kids&#8217; next Maker Party will be held at RLabs in August. Stay tuned!</p>
<h4>School of Open Tanzania&nbsp;&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://creativecommons.org/images/international/tz.png"/></h4>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Tanzania">CC Tanzania</a> is planning to host three sets of trainings. The first will be an ICT empowerment training for unemployed youth, the second will focus on teaching persons with disabilities how to use computers, and the third will focus on training educators on using ICT to improve how they teach their students. Participants will become new School of Open volunteers, improving and running future training programs as a way to give back to and grow their community. Development will be led by CC Tanzania volunteers with expertise in law, journalism, and information technology. CC Tanzania will host a joint SOO Africa launch event + Mozilla Maker Party, date and location TBD.</p>
<h4>School of Open Nigeria&nbsp;&nbsp;<img decoding="async" src="https://creativecommons.org/images/international/ng.png"/></h4>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Nigeria">CC Nigeria</a> will, in five weekends, train participants on Nigerian copyright law, intellectual property protection, and the Linux operating system. The training will have two tracks: the first track being copyright law and the second being the Linux operating System. Participants will have the opportunity to choose either or both tracks. CC Nigeria also plans to host a joint SOO Africa launch event + Mozilla Maker Party during the training. During the event, experienced web users will train participants on easy ways to creating content using Mozilla tools.</p>

<h3>About Maker Party</h3>
<p><em>School of Open and Creative Commons is excited to be partnering with Mozilla to celebrate teaching and learning the web with <a href="http://party.webmaker.org/">Maker Party</a>. Through thousands of community-run events around the world, Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic Internet users of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<p>We share Mozilla&#8217;s belief that the web is a global public resource that&#8217;s integral to modern life: it shapes how we learn, how we connect and how we communicate. But many of us don&#8217;t understand its basic mechanics or what it means to be a citizen of the web. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re supporting this global effort to teach web literacy through hands-on learning and making with Maker Party.</em></p>

<h2>New Web Space</h2>
<p>We have a new web space! Previously, communications about our major projects have been scattered throughout the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/school-of-open">blogosphere</a> and various wiki, Lernanta, and WordPress pages. But today we are happy to announce that there is one place you can visit to learn about and get involved with the School of Open, including newbies who just want to find a course to take. </p>
<p>Our web address hasn&#8217;t changed; it&#8217;s still <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">http://schoolofopen.org</a>. We invite any and all feedback at our <a href="http://thepeople.p2pu.org/category/school-of-open">new discussion space</a>.</p>
<h2>New Courses</h2>
<p>After wrapping our first round of facilitated courses on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42142">copyright, Creative Commons</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41933">Wikipedia</a> earlier this year, we continued to develop courses for independent or group study. Here are the ones we recently launched, including a collaboration with Mozilla&#8217;s Webmaker initiative!</p>
<p>(Check out <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/courses/#stand-alone-courses">all of our stand-alone courses</a> regardless of when they launched.)</p>
<p><strong>→ <a href="https://training.instructure.com/courses/1276118">How to use Open Educational Resources (OER)</a></strong></p>
<p>Developed by Boyoung Chae and co. over at the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC), this course was initially designed to help onboard community college faculty and staff with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>-licensed textbooks coming out of WA&#8217;s <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a> project. We&#8217;ve since worked with them to adapt the course for the general public!</p>
<p>The self-paced modules walk you through how to incorporate open educational resources into your teaching practice, in addition to using open licenses and locating existing OER. One past participant <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/76iHswxqYgvF">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How to Use OER is a great introduction to this amazing development in education. This will establish a good foundation for understanding the various components of open resources or fill in gaps that you might have. I am grateful the course will remain open after completion so that the materials and discussions can be revisited.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>→ <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2178/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina/">ABC of Copyright for Librarians in Latin America</a></strong></p>
<p>This Spanish language course seeks to help librarians and library users strengthen their knowledge of copyright laws in Latin America and the challenges that exist to access to information in the 21st century. CC affiliates from Colombia, El Salvador and Uruguay, in collaboration with the Karisma Foundation, developed this course in response to increasingly restrictive copyright laws in Latin America and around the globe. The course contains examples, analysis and open models based on Latin American cases and legislation. Read more about the course launch <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42977">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>→ <a href="https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/start-here/">Mozilla Webmaker Training for Teachers (and other web users)</a></strong></p>
<p>Mozilla Webmaker is all about transforming web users into web <em>makers</em>, aka citizens of the web who do more than just consume content, but also create it while leveraging open resources and tools. The new Mozilla Webmaker Training for Teachers embeds knowledge about open throughout its set of self-paced modules that will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>	&#8220;Integrate the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web into your practice.&#8221;</li>
<li>	&#8220;Bring creativity to your teaching through open, participatory methods.&#8221;</li>
<li>	&#8220;Connect with fellow mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Survey</h2>
<p>In collaboration with the OER Research Hub, we&#8217;ve been <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40393">conducting research</a> on the impact of School of Open courses. As part of this project, we invite you to participate in a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/School_Of_Open_ALL">survey</a> we created for participants of stand-alone courses.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t taken a course yet but plan to, the survey is linked at the end of <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/courses/#stand-alone-courses">every stand-alone course</a> so you can take it when you do complete it. The survey will remain open through the end of August. If you have ever gone through a School of Open course on your own, please:</p>

<h2>New Plans for a School of Open Africa</h2>
<p>Volunteers in Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Nigeria are planning for a School of Open Africa launch in September. Each region will develop and run a training program or course on the use and application of open resources. Stay tuned for a guest post detailing plans, and check out the current programs running in Kenya and South Africa for now:</p>
