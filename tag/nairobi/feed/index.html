<p>Our Creative Commons and School of Open volunteers in Kenya, including CC Regional Coordinator <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#alexgakuru">Alex Gakuru</a>, are hosting a formal launch event of School of Open Africa in celebration of the School of Open programs <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43856">launched last month</a> in Africa, and to announce new programs in higher education. The event will feature a panel discussion with senior government officials from the Kenyan Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Ministry of ICT along with Dr. Bitange Ndemo (University of Nairobi) and regional representatives from UNESCO and Google regarding the status of open education in Africa, School of Open&#8217;s contributions and future. Alex says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This event will help establish a conversation platform for policymakers around School of Open Africa, connecting and synchronising education and ICT policies with the innovative open education programs being led by Creative Commons volunteers in Africa. It will also connect current School of Open programs in primary and high school education to academia and NRENs<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_research_and_education_network">1</a></sup> &#8212; towards the realisation of the international aspiration for universal access to education.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional attendees include professors from local universities and law schools; participants of the copyright law course, <a href="http://copyx.org/affiliates/nairobi-kenya-cb/">CopyrightX:Kenya</a>, who will be awarded certificates of completion; our CC Kenya affiliates; and School Open Kenya leads. </p>

<p>In addition to the panel, SOO Kenya&#8217;s Simeon Oriko will present on School of Open Africa programs led to date, and Dr. Tonny Omwansa with C4DLab at the University of Nairobi will announce a new School of Open program to develop OER courses for higher education. This program will serve as a model for other universities across Africa to develop high quality open educational resources for use in higher education under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>. In celebration, CC t-shirts in Kiswahili will be distributed, &#8220;mwananchi mbunifu,&#8221; aka &#8216;creative commoner.&#8217;</p>
<p>The event is hosted at the Serena Hotel in Nairobi and will last from 9am-1pm, followed by a celebratory lunch. The event and new OER program in higher education is made possible with technical support from UNESCO and generous financial support from the Hewlett Foundation. </p>
