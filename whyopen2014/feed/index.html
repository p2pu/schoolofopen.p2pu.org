					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/whyopen2014/#comment-183&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/a&gt;.

Short answer: because I was not aware of it! But I just did a quick search on the site, and I wonder if it&#039;s something very easy for computer amateurs like myself. I was having trouble seeing how I would install Jitsi Meet from the Github page, having zero experience with Github. Then I thought maybe I just need the Jitsi package for voice and video chat, but I am not sure what a &quot;stable build&quot; versus a &quot;nightly build&quot; are. I would need some serious help to set this up; would our participants need it too?]]></description>
