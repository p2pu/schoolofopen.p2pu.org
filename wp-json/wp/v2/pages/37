To address this, School of Open volunteers from the region are offering this target group and related professionals (e.g. academic researchers, teachers, OER developers, librarian students, archivists, museum workers, others interested in heritage conservation) a series of workshops that provides the basics of copyright law for their work, in addition to knowledge of exceptions and limitations of copyright and Creative Commons licensing. The resulting material from the workshops are fashioned into a self-guided course that can be tapped on demand at a user-preferred time and date. The course may also be harnessed as a group, such as by a collective or specific institution, to be facilitated according to the conditions of a given community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Project leads<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/en\/carobotero\/\">Carolina Botero<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/es\/ColoresMari\/\">Maritza S\u00e1nchez<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/he\/Maria_Juliana\/\">Maria Juliana Soto<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Website<\/strong>:\u00a0<span class=\"author-a-0fp0z69zktz90zz67zz82z684z78zz72zk url\"><a href=\"http:\/\/internetactiva.net\/\">http:\/\/internetactiva.net\/<\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Course<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/en\/courses\/2178\/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina\/\">ABC del derecho de autor para bibliotecarios de Am\u00e9rica Latina<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>More info<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/internetactiva.net\/?p=268\">http:\/\/internetactiva.net\/?p=268<\/a>, <span class=\"author-a-0fp0z69zktz90zz67zz82z684z78zz72zk url\"><a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/weblog\/entry\/42393\">http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/weblog\/entry\/42393<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"oer-summer\">OER Summer Camp<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Where<\/strong>: <span class=\"author-a-0fp0z69zktz90zz67zz82z684z78zz72zk\">Luxi Island, China Mainland<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Who<\/strong>: Primary and middle school students<\/p>\n<p><strong>What<\/strong>: Luxi Island is a remote island off the eastern coast of China.

To address the inequity between children on the island and those on the mainland, School of Open volunteers organized a two-week open educational resources (OER) summer camp that covered science, medicine, music, dancing, and English.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Project leads<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/en\/Beibei\/\">SUN Beibei<\/a>, LIUPing, <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.creativecommons.org\/China_Mainland\">CC China Mainland Affiliate<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Report<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.net.cn\/2013\/07\/11\/2013-7-11\/\">http:\/\/creativecommons.net.cn\/2013\/07\/11\/2013-7-11\/<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>More info<\/strong> (EN): <span class=\"author-a-0fp0z69zktz90zz67zz82z684z78zz72zk url\"><a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/weblog\/entry\/41155\">https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/weblog\/entry\/41155<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><small><em>Image on front page of OER summer camp on Luxi island licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/3.0\/cn\">CC BY<\/a> by ZHU Renkai.<\/em><\/small><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"#training-programs\">\n<h2 id=\"xlp\">eXtreme Learning Process (XLP)<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Where<\/strong>: Tsinghua University, <span class=\"author-a-0fp0z69zktz90zz67zz82z684z78zz72zk\">China<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Who<\/strong>: University students<\/p>\n<p><strong>What<\/strong>: eXtreme Learning Process (XLP) is a program of Tsinghua University, Toyhouse, and CC China Mainland that is known for their series of engineering and design challenge workshops incorporating open source and CC licensing education for university students in China.
