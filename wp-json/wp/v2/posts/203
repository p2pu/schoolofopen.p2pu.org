However, there are currently no minimum guarantees that allow libraries and archives carrying out activities related to their mission such as lending books or changing the format of a film (e.g. VHS to digital) for preservation purposes. For decades, protections for authors and\/or rightsholders have been increased, while the guarantees of access and inclusion of copyright balances are at the mercy of political will.<br \/>\n&#8230;<br \/>\nThis imbalance occurs especially in developing countries, as many developed countries have already generated standards seeking to better balance copyright.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To address these challenges, CC affiliates from Colombia, El Salvador and Uruguay, in collaboration with the Karisma Foundation, have developed a course for librarians, archivists, educators, university researchers, and anyone else in the Latin American region interested in these issues. <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/en\/courses\/2178\/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina\/\">ABC of copyright for librarians in Latin America<\/a> is designed to strengthen the understanding of basic copyright concepts through examples, analysis and open models based on Latin American cases and legislation.<\/p>\n<p>The course officially launches online on <a href=\"http:\/\/internetactiva.net\/?page_id=17\">Internet Activa<\/a> at 5pm Colombia time today (UTC-5).
