One past participant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quicktopic.com\/50\/H\/76iHswxqYgvF\">said<\/a>,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;How to Use OER is a great introduction to this amazing development in education. This will establish a good foundation for understanding the various components of open resources or fill in gaps that you might have. I am grateful the course will remain open after completion so that the materials and discussions can be revisited.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.org\/en\/courses\/2178\/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina\/\">ABC of Copyright for Librarians in Latin America<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Spanish language course seeks to help librarians and library users strengthen their knowledge of copyright laws in Latin America and the challenges that exist to access to information in the 21st century.
