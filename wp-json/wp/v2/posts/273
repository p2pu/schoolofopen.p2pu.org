We&#8217;ve worked to build a community around this goal &#8212; at conferences in the field, through our online &#8220;Writing Wikipedia Articles&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:WIKISOO\">WIKISOO<\/a>) course with School of Open, and through the formation of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:OPEN\">WikiProject Open<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the Barn Raising, we will focus on high priority Wikipedia articles: articles that are widely read, but that &#8212; despite ongoing efforts &#8212; remain poorly sourced, incomplete, or out of date. (In the wiki world, we often borrow the term &#8220;Barn Raising&#8221; to evoke the idea of a community coming together to build something substantial in a short time. It&#8217;s been described as a way to &#8220;make the impossible possible.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1RgXfFfjo0Zjd1nu1NAX-cDQPmWa8-GWvt59n87JwDvQ\/viewform\">register here<\/a>, whether you are attending virtually or in person. Further event information is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Barn_Raising_2014\">available online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This event is open to all! Our goal is to make significant improvements to OER related articles; so those who are brand new to Wikipedia and\/or open education might want to take a little time to prepare. We will send out helpful resources for beginners as the date gets closer.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you, online or in person, and to raising a wiki barn with you!<\/p>\n<p>Pete Forsyth<br \/>\nSara Frank Bristow<br \/>\nCommunicate OER\/WikiProject Open<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>Suggested tweet: <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Join the Wiki Barn Raising July 19!
