Here is the Executive Summary:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) and the School of Open leverage the Internet and open educational resources (OER) to create an innovative, peer-based learning model that anyone in the world can use, with or without an institution. The FCC\u2019s proposal would undercut the efforts of P2PU and related organizations by relegating them to the \u201cslow lane\u201d on the Internet, discouraging millions of would-be learners from pursuing further education to improve their careers and local economies. Research conducted on these learning models would also be hampered, slowing progress and the growth of services that depend on efficient access to resources.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em>We therefore agree with the comments of the startup community, investors, nonprofits, and millions of Americans calling for rules against unreasonable discrimination and access fees under Title II, and we disagree with the comments by AT&#038;T, Verizon, Comcast in favor of the Chairman\u2019s fast-lane proposal.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to volunteer Lila Bailey for helping us file!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P2PU + School of Open filed comments yesterday in support of Net Neutrality!<br \/>\nYou can access the full comments at <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/P2PUSchoolofOpenNNReplyComments.pdf\">http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/P2PUSchoolofOpenNNReplyComments.pdf<\/a>.
