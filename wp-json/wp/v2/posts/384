Through thousands of community-run events around the world, Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic Internet users of all ages and skill levels.<\/p>\n<p>We share Mozilla&#8217;s belief that the web is a global public resource that&#8217;s integral to modern life: it shapes how we learn, how we connect and how we communicate. But many of us don&#8217;t understand its basic mechanics or what it means to be a citizen of the web. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re supporting this global effort to teach web literacy through hands-on learning and making with Maker Party.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following on the heels of School of Open Africa launch events in Tanzania and Nigeria <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/school-of-open-launches-in-tanzania-and-nigeria\/\">last weekend<\/a>, the School of Open Kenya is hosting our own tomorrow to kick off training for four high schools in Nairobi.<br \/>\n(SOO logo <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/about\/\">here<\/a>.
