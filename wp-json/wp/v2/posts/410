It is open to all educators around the world, specifically targeted to teachers, teacher-librarians from K-12, and university students studying to become teachers in Australia. The course material is learnt around practical case studies faced by teachers when using copyright material in their day-to-day teaching and educational instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course is not taught; it is facilitated by course leaders. The course emphasizes student participation. Students are divided into small groups in which they organise their online communications\/discussions (via email, Google docs, Skype, tokbox, and other tools) and jointly submit answers to each week\u2019s task.<\/p>\n<p>The course leaders review each group\u2019s work that has been submitted to that week\u2019s Google document and provide feedback. As stated above, the leaders act as facilitators rather than traditional teachers.<\/p>\n<p>The Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course has successfully been run seven times previously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) \u2013 Next Cycle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The next Copyright 4 Educators (AUS) course will run for seven weeks, with a two-week introduction period and five weeks of substantive material. Each week covering substantive material will be comprised of a different case scenario and tasks. Each group will have one week to complete each week\u2019s tasks and two days to provide peer review to two other groups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course Breakdown by weeks:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>1. October 27: Welcome to the course and introductory questionnaire <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Course participants acquaint themselves with the course and introduce themselves by answering a questionnaire. The questionnaires should be completed by Sunday November 2.<\/p>\n<p><em>2. November 3: Group meet and greet <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Course participants are divided into groups &#8211; meet and greet with fellow group members as well as become acquired with the ICT tools needed in the course, which will allow the group members to make a decision on the collaborative tool the group will use. This decision should be made by November 9 in preparation for your first group task in week 3.<\/p>\n<p><em>3. November 10: Copyright Basics<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Week 3 is the first week of substantive material, covering copyright basics such as subject matter categories, whether copyright applies, and copyright ownership. Group answers need to be submitted to that week\u2019s google doc by the end of Sunday November 16, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie November 18.<\/p>\n<p><em>4. November 17: Statutory licences <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Week 4 covers statutory licences and what teachers are and are not permitted to do under the statutory licences. Group answers need to be submitted to that week\u2019s google doc by the end of Sunday November 23, and peer review needs to be completed by the Tuesday after the assignment is due, ie November 25.<\/p>\n<p><em>5.
