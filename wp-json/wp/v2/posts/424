The goal was to work with these students to map out education as they currently experience it in their school and figure out how best to incorporate Open Education in their learning. For most of the afternoon, the emphasis on the workshop centered on figuring out how the students could incorporate Open Education in their learning. After a brief discussion, we mapped out learning and education activities as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures\/Class instruction<\/li>\n<li>    Private study\/prep<\/li>\n<li>    Group study<\/li>\n<li>    Revision of past examination papers<\/li>\n<li>    Student Symposiums<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We asked them if we could add aspects of Open Education to this list. Very few of the students had heard about Open Education or understood its value at this point. We discussed Open Education in a little more detail: We explored the concept of the commons, copyright and copyleft and how the Creative Commons suite of licenses has enabled the Open Education movement globally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><u>The future of SOO Kenya:<\/u><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the themes that stood out is getting school administrations and teachers to understand and make an investment in Open Education. This will be Jamlab\u2019s focus in the coming year. While we work with administrators and teachers, we encouraged students to begin to demonstrate the value of Open Education by creating demand for it in the following ways: consume OER\u2019s and integrate them in their learning, and pro-actively create and share OER\u2019s with other students from other schools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h4>School of Open Tanzania<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/terms\/\" xmlns:cc=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/ns#\" about=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soo-tanzania_group.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soo-tanzania_group.jpg\" alt=\"SOO Tanzania\" \/><br \/><small><a href=\"\"><span property=\"dc:title\">SOO Tanzania launch<\/span><\/a> \/ <span property=\"cc:attributionName\">CC Tanzania<\/span> \/ <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/\">CC BY<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<p>Paul from <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.creativecommons.org\/Tanzania\">CC Tanzania<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/cc-tanzania-launched-the-school-of-open-in-style\/\">says<\/a>, &#8220;The program officially launched at Academic International Primary School (AIPS) in Dar es Salaam whereby 15 students from grades four to seven got the opportunity to learn how to code, designing animated picture (cartoons) by using open educational resources through the web.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><u>The future of SOO Tanzania:<\/u><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The event also marked the launch of three other training programs around ICT empowerment training for unemployed youth, teaching persons with disabilities how to use computers, and training educators on using ICT to improve how they teach their students in Tanzania that will be coordinated by CC Tanzania and the Open University of Tanzania.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>CC Tanzania will also highlight the importance of open access to research during Open Access Week in collaboration with the Tanzania Medical Students Association (TAMSA). <\/p>\n<h4>School of Open Nigeria<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/terms\/\" xmlns:cc=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/ns#\" about=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soo-nigeria-4.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/soo-nigeria-4.jpg\" alt=\"SOO Nigeria\" \/><br \/><small><a href=\"https:\/\/secure.flickr.com\/photos\/91116545@N03\/15212584119\/\"><span property=\"dc:title\">SOO Nigeria Saturday training<\/span><\/a> \/ <span property=\"cc:attributionName\">K-Why<\/span> \/ <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/\">CC BY<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n<p>Kayode from <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.creativecommons.org\/Nigeria\">CC Nigeria<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommonsng.org\/\">says<\/a>, &#8220;Creative Commons Nigeria with support from Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Linux Professional Institute (Nigerian Master Affiliate) and Mozilla Foundation hosted the School of Open.

Four courses will be developed in collaboration with the C4DLab, the University of Nairobi&#8217;s innovation hub, and will be licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/\">CC BY<\/a>. The project is a response to ICT playing a critical role in expanding the knowledge economy of Africa; the OER will be developed by and for Africans; and the hope is to replicate the process in other universities. In addition, certificates will be awarded to participants of <a href=\"http:\/\/copyx.org\/affiliates\/nairobi-kenya-cb\/\">CC Kenya&#8217;s CopyrightX satellite<\/a> from earlier this year, a panel discussion on OER will be featured, and SOO Kenya will present its work to date. The event and C4DLab OER project is made possible with technical support from UNESCO and generous support from the Hewlett Foundation. Stay tuned for a more detailed announcement of this event next week!<\/p>\n<p>At its core, School of Open is about equipping communities with the tools to help them do what they already do better. Creative Commons licenses and the open resources they enable empowers users around the world to, as Simeon of SOO Kenya <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolofopen.p2pu.org\/popjam-school-of-open-africa-kenya-event\/\">says<\/a>, &#8220;build on what we already know.&#8221; He says,  <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think one thing we often forget to highlight when it comes to education is how we learn&#8230; We learn by building on what we already know. We believe Open Education is one sure way of building on what we already know to advance ourselves.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are seeking to expand School of Open to other regions, in and beyond Africa. The upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/mozillafestival.org\/\">Mozilla Festival<\/a> will feature a session on mapping School of Open programs from around the world and hone in on areas with maximum potential for impact &#8212; where we can &#8220;train the trainers&#8221; or otherwise empower student and educator communities to start up programs for themselves.
