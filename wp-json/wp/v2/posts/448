We had 139 people sign up to the course, which looked at the theory and practice of open research, how you can be ethical and open, how to disseminate in the open and open reflection.

Collaboration was central to building the course and as an <a title=\"Open Research blog post \" href=\"http:\/\/oerresearchhub.org\/2014\/06\/19\/open-research-course-update\/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier blog post<\/a> shows continuous evaluation and input was essential to make <em>Open Research<\/em> possible.<\/p>\n<p>As a team we\u2019re still reflecting on the experience of creating and running the course, but would like to thank everyone who contributed, commented, reviewed materials and participated. The range of course participants, from all over the world and with all kinds of backgrounds and interests in open research, who joined us on the Hangouts and commented in the forums or used the course Twitter hashtag (#openresearch) was quite amazing and it was a privilege to work with so many people who were keen to share their ideas and experiences during the course.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to building on the success of this first iteration of <em>Open Research<\/em>, while also looking at where we can improve the material and course design. A post-course survey, forum comments and blog posts by participants as well as the team\u2019s reflections will all feed into this review process. In addition, if you did not participate in the course but have suggestions or feedback, we would welcome your thoughts via <a title=\"Hackpad \" href=\"https:\/\/p2pu.hackpad.com\/Open-Research-Course-Feedback-and-Suggestions-tUU5LikTyxS\" target=\"_blank\">this Hackpad<\/a>.
